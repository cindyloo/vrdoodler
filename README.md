Draw in 3d online!  Then load it in your phone browser and view with a Google cardboard!

Virtual reality has been touted as the “next best thing” by many. 
However, many of its products as well as development platforms are proprietary and costly.  

VRDoodler makes this rapidly expanding medium more accessible to everyone because anyone can go to the web page, 
draw/sketch their spatialized ideas, and render them into a virtual reality(3D) space. I welcome your enhancement requests or inputs!!!

This uses node.js - 
To run locally: install node.js and '>npm install ...' the requisite modules as noted in the server.js file. Download the VRDoodler files into a folder, run >node server.js in the terminal. Access vrdoodler.html via localhost:8080

otherwise, pop over to vrdoodler.com to check it out. Also please follow at @vrdoodlerdotcom

Currently in ALPHA!!! Lots of cool features to add, I just need time - and more hands!

NOTE: ONLY supported in CHROME!!!
(D)raw toggles drawing. When not drawing, you can rotate the camera, zoom in/out, and decide the angle at which to draw. Use (S)nap To to attach the new line to previous line or to draw along that same plane; when not drawing, the Snap To orbits the camera round the drawn object. press Shift to 'lock' the drawing plane.  (r)otate rotates at 90 degrees- helpful if you are drawing a house or some such.
